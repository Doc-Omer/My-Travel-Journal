In my journey of self-learning React. I made this "My-Travel-Journal".

This project was given in the Scrimba course (link to course below).

This was a solo project that I had to do without any walkthrough. This project took me 6 continous hours to complete as a total beginner in React and Javascript. I know this is like an hour work but as a self-learner-beginner. This is a small achievement.
